Introduction

The Quantum Intermediate Representation Execution Engine (QIR-EE, pronounced 'cure-ee')
[#qiree_vers]_ is a tool designed to streamline the process of running quantum circuits
and algorithms to make your journey into quantum computing as seamless as possible.
This implementation is associated to the paper "A Cross-Platform Execution Engine for
the Quantum Intermediate Representation" [#qiree_paper]_ and is maintained by the QIR-EE
Developers.

At version |release|, this work represents the feasibility of a modular workflow at
the lower end of the quantum software stack. We welcome feedback and ideas for
collaborations.

To get started, we recommend following the installation instructions
:ref:`here<installation>` and being mindful of dependency requirements.
